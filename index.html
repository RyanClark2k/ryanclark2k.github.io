    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column left">
        <p>
            I am an undergraduate senior majoring in Computer Science and Economics at Caltech. I'm expecting to graduate
            in June 2022 and will be starting work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.palantir.com/" target="_blank">Palantir</a> later in August.
            I'm really excited to join the company, where I'll be working on the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/" target="_blank">Gotham</a> backend in New York City.
            One of my main interests as a software engineer is creating powerful abstractions that generalize across many seemingly distinct problem domains. That was a core component of my
            six month internship at <a href="https://www.uncountable.com/" target="_blank">Uncountable</a>, and I'm excited to work on similar problems at Palantir. In addition to software engineering,
            I play chess and soccer and enjoy the outdoors.

            <b> Full Stack Software Engineering Intern · Uncountable · March 2021 - September 2021 </b>   
        </li>
        At <a href="https://www.uncountable.com/" target="_blank">Uncountable</a>, I built a no-code tool that engineers, account managers, and customers use to configure data uploads into the company's cloud platform. Previously, every time a customer wanted to extract data from a new file format, an engineer would have to write custom code to parse the file and restructure the data. This process could take weeks of back-and-forth with the customer before getting it right. With my system, this work can now be done in minutes in most cases, and usually an engineer does not even need to be involved. In the last month of my internship, customers uploaded more than 5,400 files using the infrastructure I worked on. In addition to my main project, I worked on sales demos that helped close several large deals, contributed to core platform features, and closed dozens of support tickets relating to database optimization, UX improvements, and bug fixes.

            <b> Software Engineering Intern · Western Asset Management · June 2020 - September 2021 </b> 
        </li>
        I worked as a software engineering intern for four months at <a href="https://www.westernasset.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Western Asset Management</a>, a global asset management firm. My primary project at Western Asset was to create a new tool for analyzing a portfolio's risk exposure.
        The previous method for calculating exposure relied on complicated simulations that took 20 or more minutes to run. I was able to reduce this delay to under two minutes using a more efficient numeric approach. Additionally, I utilized caching to update the calculations in seconds, allowing users to simulate trades and reprocess the data in real time.
        Because of these improvements, my tool was adopted by dozens of Risk Managers and my internship was extended so that I could further develop the tool.

            <b> Research Assistant · Caltech Emotion and Social Cognition Lab · June 2019 - September 2021 </b>
        </li>
        I worked with Professor Damian Stanley (visiting from Adelphi University) in Caltech's <a href="http://emotion.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Emotion and Social Cognition Lab</a> to develop models of implicit cognitive bias. We used popular data science tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Jupyter, and STAN to analyze a database of Implicit Association Test results and model the relationship between implicit and explicit bias.

            <b> Software Engineer · Caltech Department of Geology · October 2018 - July 2019</b>
        </li>
        I contributed to the development of a Python interface to the <a href="https://magmasource.caltech.edu/alphamelts/" target="_blank">alphaMELTS</a> computational petrology program for the Caltech Department of Geology. In addition to my work on the Python port, I developed visualization tools and feature demonstrations.

            <b> Teaching Assistant · Caltech · 2021 </b>
        </li>
        In Winter 2021 I was a teaching assistant for CS 21: Decidability and Tractability. The class covered complexity theory, reductions, and other topics related to the theory of computation. I led weekly office hours and graded sets and exams for a class of over 100 students. Later that year in Fall 2021 I was a TA for ACM 104: Applied Linear Algebra. Once again, I led weekly office hours and graded homework sets and exams.
